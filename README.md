# Legends of Tetris

This is a tetris game for discerning tetris players.

Written with clean logic and very customisable. Just HTML and javascript. It's only runtime dependencies are the react-like [inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno) library, and the very small [pure-store](https://github.com/gunn/pure-store).

## Get started

To fetch the dependencies, run your choice of `npm install` or `yarn`.

To use the hot-reloading server while developing: `npm run start` or `yarn start`.

To bundle for production: `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
